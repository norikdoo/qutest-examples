### What is QUTest?

QUTest™ (pronounced "cutest") is a unit testing harness (a.k.a. unit testing
framework), which is specifically designed for deeply embedded systems, but
also supports unit testing of embedded code on host computers ("dual
targeting"). QUTest™ is the fundamental tooling for Test-Driven Development
(TDD) of QP/C/C++ applications, which is a highly recommended best-practice.
